## Content Insights:
I used CodeAcademy and W3schools to help relearn the function and content of how to use HTML and CSS

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I found using CodeAcademy help a lot at explain and giving desciptive examples on how each part/module of HTML and CSS is used.
With CodeAcademy help kept me engaged more in re-learning. I would see myself using Code Academy and some videos to help keep myself 
engaged and split time with constate re-learning content or learning new content.
