## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU to inform myself on what is expected of me for this subject from the Subject Coordinator's point of view as I was informed that this subject is often under greater scrutiny.
- I rewent through my CP 1406 notes, practicals and assignments as I was my HTML and CSS skills were relatively rusty. I had a go with some coding as well and recalled many concepts from there.
- I followed the tutorials on the JCU website to connect my LinkedIn to the LinkedIn Learning access offered by JCU. I then read the Subject Outline and saved all the Learning Resources(LinkedIn Learning courses) studied in this subject for easier access.

## Content Insights:
I used CodeAcademy and W3schools to help relearn the function and content of how to use HTML and CSS

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I found using CodeAcademy help a lot at explain and giving desciptive examples on how each part/module of HTML and CSS is used.
With CodeAcademy help kept me engaged more in re-learning. I would see myself using Code Academy and some videos to help keep myself 
engaged and split time with constate re-learning content or learning new content.
