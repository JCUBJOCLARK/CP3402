## Learning Activities:

- I watched the lecture recording on LearnJCU to inform myself on what is expected of me for this subject from the Subject Coordinator's point of view as I was informed that this subject is often under greater scrutiny.
- I went through my CP 1406 notes, practicals, and assignments, and as I was my HTML and CSS skills, were relatively rusty. I had a go with some coding as well and recalled many concepts from there.
- I followed the tutorials on the JCU website to connect my LinkedIn to the LinkedIn Learning access offered by JCU. I then read the Subject Outline and saved all the Learning Resources(LinkedIn Learning courses) studied in this subject for easier access.
- This week's learning resource was once again a refresher on HTML, CSS, and Javascript but also delved deeper in terms of UX and UI issues and concepts than CP 1406. I found them to be deeply informative.
- I got done with the the learning resource on Monday so I only had about 2 days to complete the Prac 1 so I used a template from W3Schools

## Resources/Links:

- W3Schools(https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Estimated Hours:

14 hours (Across 2 days)

## Content Insights:
I made use of the Codepen interface to practice some HTML, CSS, and Javascript methods.
I was also introduced to a lot of different software used in the industry which I plan to try in my spare time.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
I would usually just jump right into coding in Visual Studio without much planning and preparation. However, after using tools such as Figma and Codepen, I found it much easier to plan my work and would probably facilitate collaborative work or picking up work after a hiatus.
It was my first time using LinkedIn Learning and I really appreciate the course structure, assessment structure, and length which kept me interested while not being too long-winded or devoid of new information. This is a great sign personally as I am aware that this course involves a lot of self-learning, especially using videos available on LinkedIn Learning. I'm thrilled to progress through this course.
